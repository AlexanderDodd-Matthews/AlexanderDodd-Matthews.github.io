        <p>At the Siege of Terra during the Horus Heresy, many Champions of Chaos arose from the Traitor Marines' ranks. During this time, the Primarch of the Imperial Fists, Rogal Dorn, chose the Imperial Fists' First Captain Sigismund to fulfill the role of the Emperor's Champion. First Captain Sigismund was given the best armour and weapons the Legion possessed, and he swore a holy duty to seek out and destroy the foul Champions of Chaos. He did so by challenging over two dozen of the enemy leaders to single combat and slaying them or banishing them back into the Immaterium. At the end of the Horus Heresy, each of the Space Marine Legions was broken down into smaller organisations known as Chapters, each composed of one thousand Astartes, as part of a plan to spread the power of the Imperial armed forces so that no one man could bring to bear the influence that the Warmaster Horus had over the Space Marines.</p>

        <p>Rogal Dorn, as Primarch of the Legion responsible for the defence of the Emperor's homeworld, Terra, initially refused to have his Legion broken down. Dorn fought with his fellow Primarch Roboute Guilliman over the issue, calling the Ultramarines' Primarch a coward, and Guilliman in turn accused Dorn of heresy and disloyalty to the Emperor. The Primarchs Leman Russ of the Space Wolves and Vulkan of the Salamanders favoured Dorn's stance while Jaghatai Khan of the White Scars and Corax of the Raven Guard supported Guilliman's position on the issue. It was only after an attack on the Imperial Fists' Strike Cruiser Terrible Angel by the Imperial Navy and the threat of a renewed civil war between Dorn's Legion and the newly-formed Successor Chapters of the other First Founding Legions that he decided to relent and allow the Imperial Fists to be divided.</p>

        <p>One of the Imperial Fists' first Successor Chapters, the Black Templars have since become one of the largest and most feared Space Marine Chapters. The surviving Imperial Fists were split into four Chapters during the Second Founding. The younger warriors became the Crimson Fists, while Dorn's chosen warriors remained the Imperial Fists, and the orbital assault specialists were long believed, erroneously, to have formed the ranks of the infamous Soul Drinkers Chapter. The fourth Imperial Fists Second Founding Successor Chapter were the Black Templars. Sigismund, named the Black Templars' first Chapter Master, took with him the most zealous of the Imperial Fists brethren and those that shared his fervour took on the black and white panoply of Sigismund's armour, and then they embarked on an Imperial Crusade to prove their loyalty to the Emperor. Sigismund refused to adhere to the Codex Astartes, seeing the foundational treatise written by Roboute Guilliman as an insult to the teachings of his own Primarch, Rogal Dorn. Instead, he led his warriors into the depths of space, taking the war directly to the enemies of the Imperium.</p>

        <p>In the centuries since, the Chapter has diverted even further from the standard tenets of the Adeptus Astartes. Embracing their faith and acknowledging the God-Emperor's divinity, the Black Templars have developed a fanatical zealotry and aggressiveness. This deviation from orthodoxy disturbs many of their fellow Space Marine Chapters, though the Black Templars' dedication to eradicating the enemies of Humanity cannot be questioned. Sigismund swore an oath "to prove his loyalty, never resting in the prosecution of his duties against the enemies of the Emperor." It is an oath that every succeeding High Marshal has renewed, resulting in the longest Space Marine crusade in the history of the Imperium. It has smashed through the stars for over 10,000 years and came to the fore during the wars for Armageddon.</p>

        <p>The Black Templars Chapter is the only Space Marine Chapter in existence known to still follow the Emperor's original vision of a Great Crusade to protect and reunite all the scattered worlds of Mankind across the galaxy. Since their creation during the Second Founding from the survivors of the Imperial Fists Legion, the Black Templars have waged a righteous war against the many enemies of the Imperium, the single longest Imperial Crusade in its history, persecuting the witch, the alien and the Heretic with a devotional zeal unmatched by the other Chapters.</p>
