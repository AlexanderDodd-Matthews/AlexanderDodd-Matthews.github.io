        <p>The Black Templar Castellan - Black Templar Castellans function as Lieutenants for this esoteric successor Chapter. Acting as the right hand of their Marshal, they help direct their battle-brothers in war. By handling the squad-level combat logistics of force coordination and acting as exemplary leaders, they free up their Marshals to focus on the wider strategic picture of the entire war zone.

Based on an iconic piece of Black Templars artwork by John Blanche, this Castellan brings the firepower-enhancing effects of a lieutenant to the battlefield in a unique style. Covered with effigies of skulls, wielding a combi-flamer and master-crafted power axe, this distinctive miniature is the perfect way to add some retro flavour to your Black Templars force.</p>

      <div class="right">
        <p>Chaplain Grimaldus and Retinue - As grizzled a warrior as his Chapter has ever known, High Chaplain Grimaldus is a beacon of Imperial faith. His fortitude is such that many of his brothers believe him invincible. His will is singular, his zeal coldly furious, and his martial skill attested by the trail of broken foes laid at his heels and his legendary stand at Helsreach. His Cenobyte Servitors lurch to war at his side, bearing with them holy relics of the faith.

          Armed with a plasma pistol and artificer crozius, Grimaldus strides into combat to smite enemy psykers. He is accompanied by a procession of servitors who inspire the Black Templars to ever more impressive acts of heroism and devotion to secure the Emperor's favour.</p>

        <p>The Black Templars Combat Patrol - The Black Templars are the Adeptus Astartes' most zealous Chapter, charging into battle to meet their foes face-to-face and deliver the Emperor's justice at the point of a sword. So great is their fervour that they chain their weapons to their wrists, ensuring their bolters and blades leave their hands on victory, or not at all.

          Raise a prayer to the God-Emperor and set forth to battle with Combat Patrol: Black Templars. This boxed set provides you with all the units you need to get started or to build on an existing force. The contents of this set have been specifically chosen to provide you with an ideal Black Templars force for Combat Patrol-sized games, approximately 25 Power Level's worth of miniatures.</p>

      <div class="right">
        <p>Primaris Crusader Squad - Infused with the post-human might of the Primaris miracle, these Crusader Squads storm into battle with bolt rifles blazing and Astartes chainswords howling. Initiates aim jets of fire from their pyreblasters or swing crackling power fists into their foes, while hard-eyed Neophytes fight furiously to prove their martial worth.

          Lead by a Veteran Sword Brother, Crusader Squads mix brand new Primaris Initiates in with Neophytes testing their mettle. Like many Black Templars squads, they are equipped with a range of melee and ranged weapons.
          
          The six Primaris Initiates have a variety of helmeted heads and unhelmeted heads. Two Initiates can be built with a choice of auto bolt rifle or heavy bolt pistol and Astartes chainsword, while the third can be built with an auto bolt rifle, a pyreblaster, or a heavy bolt pistol and an Astartes chainsword, with the option to change the chainsword to a power fist.
          
          Alternatively, one Initiate can be built as a Sword Brother, who has a choice of helmeted and unhelmeted heads. He can be built with a power sword or power axe, and a heavy bolt pistol or pyre pistol.
          
          The four Neophytes have four unhelmeted head options and can be equipped with either bolt carbines or bolt pistols and Astartes chainswords.</p>

        <p>The Emperor's Champion - The Emperor's Champion is a humble warrior plucked out of the ranks of the Black Templars by the divine will of the Emperor himself. The furious blows of the enemy ring from his nigh-impenetrable Armour of Faith, while the Champion seeks out enemy generals and heroes and slays them with sweeping blows from his Black Sword.

Wreathed in golden light, these implacable warriors can shrug off countless wounds and, in return, strike down innumerable foes. Their holy wargear is held in the Reclusiam of the Black Templars, and should the Champion falter and fall, crusades are launched to recover these sacred armaments.</p>

      <div class="right">
        <p>High Marshal Helbrecht - Helbrecht is the living embodiment of his Chapter's warrior spirit. Wielding the Sword of the High Marshals, he storms into the fray, bellowing oaths of vengeance as he leads the unstoppable charge. His battle-brothers follow him without question, for they believe where High Marshal Helbrecht treads, so too walks the Emperor himself.

          High Marshal Helbrecht is accompanied by two attendant thralls, one of which carries his powerful combi-melta, Ferocity, while the other wipes clean the Sword of the High Marshals. Helbrecht rouses the Black Templars who fight alongside him to great feats of valour, turning the battlefield around him into a bloody melee. High Marshal Helbrecht can be built with a choice of three different heads, two unhelmeted, and an optional impaled Ork at his feet.</p>

      <div class="right">
        <p>Black Templars Marshall - Leading their Black Templars brethren from the front lines, Marshals exemplify the strength and skill of the warriors under their command. They are paragons of strategic genius with centuries of battlefield experience, and their great deeds are often rewarded with ancient artefacts drawn from the Chapter's vaults.

          Whereas Codex-compliant Chapters take to the battlefields under the command of Captains, the Black Templars are lead by the fearsome Marshals, whose commanding presence enhances the abilities of the Space Marines who fight alongside them. Armed with a choice of a power sword or power axe and a plasma pistol or auto-flamer, this mighty warrior is an ideal HQ choice. You can also choose between two heads for this marshal, both are unhelmeted, one wearing a rebreather while the other wears a circlet crown.

      <div class="right">
        <p>Black Templars Sword Brethren - Every Sword Brother has earned their place among the Marshal's household through acts of unswerving faith and spectacular violence. On the battlefield, they are a reaping whirlwind, unstoppable, uncompromising, armed with a lethal assortment of powered blades and thundering pistols that they turn upon the enemy in the Emperor's name.

          These veteran warriors battle with a mix of melee and ranged weapons. They are lead by a Castellan who can be equipped with a master-crafted power sword or Astartes chainsword in their right hand and a heavy bolt pistol, auto-plasma, or skull relic in their left. The four remaining Sword Brethren can be constructed with a mix of weapons, including a heavy bolt pistol, pyre pistol, plasma pistol, Astartes chainswords, power swords, power maul, power axe, a set of paired lightning claws, or a thunder hammer. This kit also comes with a range of unique heads, backpack finials, and various tilting plates.</p>
