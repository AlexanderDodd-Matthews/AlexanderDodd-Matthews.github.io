      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>The Black Templars Castellan, like the Marshal from the Black Templars Army Set, is a named rank within the Black Templars. The Marshal is a uniquely armed Primaris Captain, and the Castellan is a Primaris Lieutenant armed with a combi-flamer and master-crafted power axe. There are also options to arm your Castellan with either a heavy bolt pistol or auto-plasma and chainsword or master-crafted power sword.</p>

        <p>The Castellan box doesn't have any armament options other than those pictured. But that's not an issue, the combi-flamer lets you deal damage at range, then burn your enemies at shorter range, before closing the distance with the power axe for four, strength six attacks with -2 AP and two damage per hit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left">
        <img src="img/ChaplainGrimaldusandRetinueLead.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>The Hero of Helsreach also returns with a great new miniature and great new new Datasheet. Grimaldus shares a similar statline to his regular Chaplain counterparts albeit with a better Crozius. His retinue of servitors also bestow some cool abilities on Grimaldus (which are not impacted by the destruction of said servitors strangely enough). The Banner of the Fallen Crusaders allows nearby Core and Character units to Advance D3+3″ instead of 6″ meaning you'll have no trouble crossing the battlefield. The Remnant of the Fallen Temple grants a 6+ wound shrug to nearby Core and Character units and finally the Scepptre of Annointing lets Grimaldus add +1 to his roll when attempting to inspire a Litany.

        That's not all though, he can also attempt to Deny the Witch (twice if he is your Warlord) and finally he stands back up again on a 4+ with 3 wounds remaining at the end of a phase in which he was destroyed (once per battle).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>The Black Templars Combat Patrol holds a collection of different units for the faction in the Combat Patrol game mode. Utilising a mix of melee units which is traditionally what makes up  the Black Templars units, it also makes use of a Primaris Impulsor transport. 5 Intercessors add ranged bolters to the combar patrol with medium range weaponry and the Primaris Marshal enhances the force with its use of orders.</p>        
      </div>
      <div class="left">
        <img src="img/CrusaderSquadLead.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>An Iconic Black Templars unit give a Primaris refresh. These have the standard Primaris statline with the Neophytes having -1 Ld and Sv. They have a great selection of wargear options from Auto Bolt-Rifles, Astartes Shotguns, Chainswords and the new Pyreblaster/pistol. The Sword Brother can take additional options such as Power Fist or Axe as well. What's great about this unit is you can take up to 20 models, granting access to multiple wargear options (5 Power Fists for example). Such a shame they can't fit in a Land Raider though.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>The assassin of enemy Characters and Monsters, the Emperor's Champion has all the rules and kit he needs to go to toe to toe with the most feasome of opponents! A bucket load of attacks with an impressive sword that again has two profiles, either a S+3 AP-3 Damage 2. or Sx2 AP-4 Damage 3 (with -1 to hit). He gets re-rolls to hit and wound against Characters, fights first against Characters and has a boosted Heroic Intervention range. He has a 4+ invulnerable save and a built in -1 to hit debuff in combat so is quite tanky (considering it's easy to add a 5+ FNP save to him as well). Unfortunetly you can't take any Relics for him but you are able to stack two Walord Traits to further improve his combat prowess.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left">
        <img src="img/HighMarshalHelbrechtLead.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>The High Marshall himself has crossed the Rubicon and has an amazing new model! On top of that he has a pretty amazing new set of rules too. Surprising cheap at 160 Helbrecht has a comparible statline to Marneus Calgar (but much much cheaper). He provides the usual Chapter Master buffs but also increases the strength of nearby Core units by 1. His weapons though are fantastic, starting with the combi Melta/Bolt-Rifle allowing him to threaten both infantry and tanks at range. Then we get to his Sword of the High Marshalls which has two profiles which he has to choose from each time he makes an attack. He can either make a Sx2, AP-3, Damage 3 two-handed attack (not bad when you can quite easily get Helbrecht up to 8 attacks) or a sweeping one-handed attack which doubles the number of attacks at S+2 AP-3 Damage 1. Helbrecht is a flexible unit able to deal with infantry or vehicles/monsters with his blade.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>A Marshal is a high-ranking officer and a Veteran Space Marine who leads the individual crusades of the Black Templars Chapter and is equivalent to a captain in a Codex Astartes-compliant Chapter. Once per battle round, you can target one unit from your army with the rites of battle ability with a Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even if another unit from your army has already been targeted by that Stratagem this phase.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>This Datasheet brings back memories of the trusty Veterans of old allowing you to build have a very flexible loadout in a single squad of up to 10 Primaries Sword Brothers. They each have the usual veteran statline with a whole raft of melee wargear options including Thunder Hammers and Lighting Claws. I actually think the stock Astartes Chainsword is a great option for these guys, especially with the various Templar Vows and buffs that can be bestowed on them. Remember as well that this unit does not suffer the drawback for the selected Templar Vow.</p>
